<h1> Background </h1>
My project focuses on the topic of juvenile recidivism, which refers to a youth offenderâ€™s return to committing criminal behaviour especially after receiving interventions for their prior offences. <br>
Unfortunately, rates of juvenile recidivism have been on the rise in recent years and many factors come to play in explaining vulnerability to juvenile recidivism, from age to gender to many other social predictors

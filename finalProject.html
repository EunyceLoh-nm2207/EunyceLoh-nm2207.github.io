      <h2 class="w3-center" style="font-family: serif;"> Introduction to Juvenile Delinqeuncy and Recidivism in Singapore </h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> 
        I said earlier that rates of juvenile recivdivism have not been reducing as expected, but where's my proof? Well, based on data from the <b>Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF)</b> in the figure below, juvenile recidivism in Singapore shows <b>an overall decrease in rate of juvenile recidivism</b> from <b>20.3 in the 2007 cohort to 12.2 in 2017 cohort.</b>
        But somewhere in the 2013 cohort, something happened and caused the rate to increase again.
        </p> 
        
      <!-- Plot 1: Line chart showing rates of juvenile recidivism over the years -->
        <div id="ratesDiv">
          <canvas id="rates-line-chart"  width="300" height="400"></canvas> 
        </div>
      
      <!-- Explanaing the insights from plot 1 -->
        <br>
        <div class="w3-border w3-block w3-dark-grey">
          <h3 style="font-family:serif;"> So... why does this matter?</h3>
            <p style="font-family:serif;"> Well, this sudden increase is worrying as it suggests that youths are still being <b>caught in a cycle of re-offence and criminality</b> despite efforts being put in place to effectively reduce the rates in the years prior.
            These efforts comprise those from agencies like the <b>MSF, Singapore Police Force (SPF) and the National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC)</b> who offer support through youth homes, and other guidance programmes to bring the rate of juvenile recidivism lower. Yet, <b> results have not been encouraging.</b>
            It is thus imperative that current services are <b>tackling root causes of delinquency</b> so that youths don't even offend in the first place. Of course, better support should also be given to those who potentially re-offend, thus it is also important to  <b> address the predictors of juvenile recidivsm. </b> </p> 
            <p style="font-family:serif;"> This then begs the question about what even causes or increases the chances of delinquency (and recidivism) in the first place. Click the next tab labelled 'Distribution of Cases by Age and Gender' to see how these very factors influence delinquency! </p>
        </div>
    </div>

  <!-- Introduction Paragraph to Juvenile Delinquency Cases Breakdown by Age -->
    <div id="cases" class="w3-container currentSituation w3-padding-48 w3-card w3-black">
      <h2 class="w3-center" style="font-family:serif;"> Looking at age </h2>
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> Let's first look at how age influences one's chances of delinquency and potential recividism! The bar charts below showcase a <b>breakdown of youths sent to Youth Homes by three age groups -- those below 13 years old, between 13 and 16 years old and above 16 years old. </b>
        Youth Homes are managed by the MSF and partially serve as a <b>place of detention and rehabilitation for juvenile delinquents who have offended the law. </b> 
        Currently, it shows how the number of cases with each age group changes over time. But use the slider located below the charts if you would like to zoom into specific time periods!  </p>
    
    <!-- Plot 2: Bar chart showing the distribution of cases by age category -->
      <div id="ageDiv" class="w3-container" width="100" height="50">
        <canvas id="age-bar-chart"></canvas> 
      </div>
  
      <div class="slidecontainer">
        <!-- Dynamic year display to show the range of data that is being displayed, which updates in accordance to how the user interacts with the slider -->      </div>
          <a id="year" style="font-family:serif;"> This is showing data from 2010-2021 </a>
        <!-- Slider which allows the user to choose the range of years which the cases are from to be displayed on the bar chart -->

        <!-- Brief Explanation of Plot 2 Data -->
          <p style="font-family:serif;"> You will notice that across time, one age group consistently stands out among the rest. 
          Which do you think it is? Indeed, the data suggests that <b>the most vulnerable age group to recidivism is between the ages of 13 to 16, </b> highlighted in red.</p>
   
    <!-- Explaining the insights from Plot 2-->
      <div class="w3-border w3-block w3-dark-grey">
        <h3 style="font-family:serif;"> So... why does this matter? </h3>
          <p style="font-family:serif;"> This is critical because it <b> informs the ages at which youths are most vulnerable to offending and by extension, the ages that should be targeted to a greater degree when it comes to intervention programmes. </b>
            Fortunately, it seems like the <b> Singapore Police Force and National Crime Prevention Council </b> have caught wind of the vulnerability of this age group, and have in fact pushed out a <b>youth engagement programme targeting secondary school students specifically! </b>
            
          <p style="font-family:serif;"> Delta League is a youth engagement programme which focuses on keeping youths occupied during school holidays through football, in hopes of reducing their contact with criminality, and by extension, that with recidivism. 
            Perhaps more of current efforts could zoom into secondary school kids to specifically target those within this age range. 
          </p>

          <p style="font-family: serif;"> Or... perhaps other demographic factors also influence the potential of youths to offend? Scroll below to examine how gender plays a role in this! </p>
      </div> 

    <!-- Introduction Paragraph to Juvenile Delinquency Cases Breakdown by Gender -->
      <h2 class="w3-center" style="font-family:serif;"> Which gender is most vulnerable? </h2>
        <p style="font-family: serif;"> Now, we have looked at the factor of age and understand that between the ages of 13 and 16 years old, youths are most vulnerable to delinquency and potential recidivism! 
        You may be wondering if there is a more vulnerable gender. </p>
        <p style="font-family: serif;"> Answer this question for yourself by clicking the button below to browse through 
        the proportions of male and female juveniles who enter MSF’s guidance programme over the years. This programme by MSF is a diversionary programme for youth offenders who commit minor offences. </p>
      
      <!-- Button which allows the user to successively click to see how the data changes with each successive year -->
        <a class="w3-button w3-border w3-dark-grey" id="updateGender" style="font-family:serif;"> Click to see how the proprtion has changed over the years! </a> 

      <!-- Plot 3: Pie chart showing the distribution of cases by gender category -->
        <div id="pieDiv" width="30" height="30">
          <canvas id="gender-pie-chart"></canvas> 
        </div>

      <!-- Explanaing the insights from Plot 3 -->
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> So... which gender is most vulnerable to offending? You probably guessed it, <b> male juveniles seemingly have a greater propensity to commit crime than female juveniles. </b>
        Interestingly, gender is posited to be one of the <b> most significant predictors of criminality with males seeing a higher prevalence and frequency of offence (Steffensmeier & Schwartz, 2009). </b> </p>
     
        <p style="font-family:serif;"> Many theories in criminology explain and support this notion but without going too in-depth <i>(and becoming a boring dump of literature),</i>
        the overarching theme in criminologists’ current understanding of gender is that <b> females are socialised to take on a more caring and relationship-focused role </b> to those around them compared to males (Gilligan, 1982; Lapsley, 1996; Messerschmidt, 1993).
        Resultantly, females are thus <b> less likely to be involved in crimes that directly hurt others </b> and feel more guilt in doing so than males. </p> 

        <div class="w3-border w3-block w3-dark-grey">
          <h3 style="font-family:serif;">  So… why are you explaining this to me? </h3> 

            <p style="font-family:serif;"> Well… I did not just dump a bunch of literature on you to show how much I know. I did it to emphasise that despite a great body of research supporting the notion that males are often more vulnerable to committing crime than females are,
            <b> Singapore seems to lack more specific resources that specially support male juvenile offenders.</b> Other than Singapore Boys' Home, an institution that offers shelter, education and mentorship to male juvenile offenders, most programmes available are generalist in nature.  </p> 

            <p style="font-family:serif;"> Of course this is not to undermine the existence and needs of female juvenile delinquents. Neither am I saying that current, general programmes are terrible. <i> But,</i> you should also notice that as you click the button above, <b> the proportion of female juvenile offenders often see a decrease while male juvenile offenders hardly do. </b>
            This once again reinforces the need for male-specific support programmes or intervention efforts in Singapore. </p>

          <p style="font-family: serif; color:white"> Let’s zoom into social predictors of juvenile recidivism. 
          A study found in the <b> Criminal Justice and Behaviour Journal (2008) </b>  found 4 significant predictors -- <b> reported father criminality, history of running away from home,

          <h3 style="font-family:serif;"> Why do I need to know this if I already know which age and gender to tackle? </h3> 
            <p style="font-family: serif;"> While knowing the specific age group and gender that are more vulnerable to juvenile delinquency, 
            knowing the nuanced social factors can allow organisations like the MSF to zoom into specific traits or characteristics of youth. 
            It amplifies how targeted the interventions and support should become, allowing for greater effectiveness of efforts.

              <div class="text" style="font-size: 20px">  According to the same study, the two factors of history of aggression and running away from home can be considered dynamic as they are able to change with planned intervention (Cottle et al., 2001). <br> <br> This means that these specific factors should be targeted in risk-reduction programmes. It is especially imperative to tackle the former dynamic factor because research shows that adolescents with aggressive behaviour increase their chances of negative outcomes such as remaining aggressive, running away from home and even early contact with criminality (Moffitt, 1993). <br> <br> Thus, it seems that being on the lookout for aggressive behaviour in youth and providing support for them early on, before it exacerbates and leads them to deviance, has become more imperative with these findings. </div>

          Existing intervention programmes that already act more closely on secondary school children (e.g. Delta League) can improve by channelling more support and attention specifically to male adolescents. Of course whilst paying mind to female adolescents as well. 
          <br> <br> 
          Additionally, the current family-support programmes, such as those conducted by the Singapore Centre for Fathering (SCFF) which aims to encourage fathers to be more involved and committed to their children and family, can be more effectively carried out alongside complementary mental health support for adolescents identified to show aggression in school.
